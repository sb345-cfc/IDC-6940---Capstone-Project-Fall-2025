Data Cleaning and Preparation\n\nData preparation is one of the most important steps because incorrect data types, missing values, and rare categories can create misleading model performance.\n\n### 2.1 Removing non-predictive identifiers\n\nThe dataset contained an ID field that had no predictive value:\n\n```r\nstroke <- stroke %>% select(-id)\n\n###2.2 Recoding and converting categorical variables to factors\n\nCategorical variables were converted to factors for proper model handling:\n\nstroke <- stroke %>%\n  mutate(\n    gender = factor(gender),\n    ever_married = factor(ever_married),\n    work_type = factor(work_type),\n    residence_type = factor(residence_type),\n    smoking_status = factor(smoking_status),\n    hypertension = factor(hypertension),\n    heart_disease = factor(heart_disease),\n    stroke = factor(stroke, levels = c(0,1), labels = c(\"No\",\"Yes\"))\n  )\n###2.3 Handling rare categories\nThe gender variable contained one case labeled “Other.”\nTo avoid model instability:\n###2.4 Cleaning and imputing BMI\nThe BMI variable contained missing values and entries such as \"N/A\".\nThese were converted and imputed using the median:\n\nstroke$bmi[stroke$bmi == \"N/A\"] <- NA\nstroke$bmi <- as.numeric(stroke$bmi)\nmedian_bmi <- median(stroke$bmi, na.rm = TRUE)\nstroke$bmi[is.na(stroke$bmi)] <- median_bmi\n\nBMI ranged from 10.3 to 97.6, with a median of 28.1, indicating a slightly right-skewed distribution due to high-BMI outliers.\n\n2.5 Verifying data integrity\nA final missing-value check confirmed the dataset was complete:\n\nsapply(stroke, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))\n\n3. Train/Test Split (Preventing Data Leakage)\n\nTo maintain class proportions while preventing data leakage, a stratified 70/30 split was used:\n\nset.seed(123)\nindex <- createDataPartition(stroke$stroke, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)\ntrain_data <- stroke[index, ]\ntest_data  <- stroke[-index, ]\n\nBoth training and test sets retained the same imbalance ratio (~5% stroke).\n\n4. Cross-Validation\n\nAll models were trained using:\n\n- 5-fold cross-validation\n\n- 3 repetitions\n\n- ROC (AUC) as the optimization metric\n\nctrl <- trainControl(\n  method = \"repeatedcv\",\n  number = 5,\n  repeats = 3,\n  classProbs = TRUE,\n  summaryFunction = twoClassSummary\n)\n\nThis ensures stable model comparison and reduces overfitting.\n\n5. Model Development (Six Classification Models)\n\nSix supervised learning models were trained using consistent preprocessing and cross-validation settings:\n\n- Logistic Regression\n\n- Decision Tree (rpart)\n\n- Random Forest\n\n- Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM)\n\n- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)\n\n- Support Vector Machine (Radial Kernel)\n\nAll models used the same formula and training control:\n\nfit_model <- train(\n  model_formula,\n  data = train_data,\n  method = \"...\",\n  trControl = ctrl,\n  metric = \"ROC\"\n)\n\nThis provides a fair, apples-to-apples comparison.\n\n6. Model Evaluation\n\nEach model was evaluated on the test set using:\n\nConfusion matrix\n\nAccuracy\n\nSensitivity (Recall)\n\nSpecificity\n\nROC curve\n\nArea Under Curve (AUC)\n\nA custom evaluation function was used to standardize comparison:\n\nevaluate_model <- function(model, test_data, positive_class = \"Yes\") {\n  pred_class <- predict(model, newdata = test_data)\n  pred_prob <- predict(model, newdata = test_data, type = \"prob\")[, positive_class]\n  cm <- confusionMatrix(pred_class, test_data$stroke, positive = positive_class)\n  \n  roc_obj <- roc(\n    response = test_data$stroke,\n    predictor = pred_prob,\n    levels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\")\n  )\n  \n  list(\n    cm = cm,\n    auc = auc(roc_obj),\n    roc_obj = roc_obj\n  )\n}\n\nUsing these metrics provides a complete understanding of each model’s ability to detect rare stroke cases.\n\nThis combined methodology from both project drafts ensures:\n\nClean, consistent, and reliable data\n\nNo data leakage\n\nProper handling of class imbalance\n\nFair cross-validated comparison across models\n\nA complete evaluation of model performance\n\nThis workflow provides a strong foundation for accurate and interpretable stroke prediction.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThis project follows a structured machine-learning workflow consisting of four key phases: **data understanding**, **data preparation**, **model development**, and **model evaluation**.
